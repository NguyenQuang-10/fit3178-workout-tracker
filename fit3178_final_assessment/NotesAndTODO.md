#  TODO
- In SetTableViewCell, declare a delegate that allows modification of the set in to main table view
- Figure out then how to save that to the exerciseSets in configureExercise and so forth
- integrate with coredata and save
- integrate with firebase
- implement login

#  Notes
- Maybe the sets for an exercise should be stored inside the workout
- And exercise can contain picture and description and name only
- What tech for each week
Week 10: Firebase Firestore and maybe login
Week 11/12: Set gym location using map/Integrate webAPI/notification for active workout
